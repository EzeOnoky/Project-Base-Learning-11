Ansible Configuration Management – Automating Project 7 to 10

## PROJECT TASK

- Install and configure Ansible client to act as a Jump Server/Bastion Host
- Create a simple Ansible playbook to automate servers configuration 

## BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE

- We can Automate routine tasks done on project 7 - 10 using [Ansible configuration management tool](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/automation/what-is-configuration-management#:~:text=Configuration%20management%20is%20a%20process,in%20a%20desired%2C%20consistent%20state.&text=Managing%20IT%20system%20configurations%20involves,building%20and%20maintaining%20those%20systems). Projects 7 to 10 you had to perform a lot of manual operations to set up virtual servers, install and configure required software, deploy your web application. This project seeks to automate all these task. At the same time you will become confident at writing code using declarative language such as [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML)


- Ansible Client as a Jump Server (Bastion Host). A Jump Server (sometimes also referred as Bastion Host) is an intermediary server through which access to internal network can be provided. If you think about the current architecture you are working on, ideally, the webservers would be inside a secured network which cannot be reached directly from the Internet. That means, even DevOps engineers cannot SSH into the Web servers directly and can only access it through a Jump Server – it provide better security and reduces attack surface. On the diagram below the Virtual Private Network (VPC) is divided into two subnets – Public subnet has public IP addresses and Private subnet is only reachable by private IP addresses.  When you reach Project 15, you will see a Bastion host in proper action. But for now, we will develop Ansible scripts to simulate the use of a Jump box/Bastion host to access our Web Servers.

## Setup and technologies used in Project 11
- 

1. - Two RHEL8 Web Servers

2. - One MySQL DB Server (based on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS)

3. - One RHEL8 NFS server

3. - One Nginx LB server(based on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS)

4. - One **Jenkins/Ansible Server** server(based on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS)

- Your target architecture will look like this:

## STEP 1      ***INSTALL AND CONFIGURE ANSIBLE ON OUR ACTIVE JENKIN SERVER***

Already Jenkins is running on our Ubuntu 20.04 server, now we will be Installing Ansible on Jenkins Server, and then on the EC2 instance, we rename it to Jenkins-Ansible. We will also use this server to run our playbooks.

### 1A.In your GitHub account create a new repository and name it `ansible-config-mgt`

#### 11_4 pix of the new repo

### 1B. We install ansible on our jenkins server and rename it to Jenkins-Ansible

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ansible
ansible --version
```

### 1C. Configure Jenkins

Make reference to your project 9,  follow the step to  configure Jenkins

- Configure Jenkins build job to save your repository content every time there is an edit.

- Create a new Freestyle project ansible in Jenkins and point it to your ‘ansible-config-mgt’ repository.

- Configure the "ansible-config-mgt" to connect to the jenkins through webhook to trigger build automatically.

- Configure a Post-build job to save and archive all artifacts i.e (**).

- Test our setup by making some change in README.MD file

Note: Trigger Jenkins project execution only for /main (master) branch.

Now your setup will look like this:

N/B: Every time the jenkins-ansible server stop/start, we have to reconfigure GitHub webhook to the new IP address. In order to avoid this, we allocate an Elastic IP to the Jenkins-Ansible server. Elastic IP is free only when it is being allocated to an EC2 Instance so we release Elastic IP once the instance is terminated.


## STEP 2      ***PREPARE THE DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT USING VS CODE***

- First part of ‘DevOps’ is ‘Dev’, which means you will require to write some codes and you shall have proper tools that will make your coding and debugging comfortable – you need an Integrated development environment (IDE) or Source-code Editor. VS Code is the preference tool to use here.

- After you have successfully installed VSC, [configure it to connect to your newly created GitHub repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR9jhYD3bnI)
